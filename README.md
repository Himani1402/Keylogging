# Keylogging
Keylogging is the process of covertly capturing and recording every keystroke made by a user on a keyboard. The data including keystrokes, system information, clipboard content, and screenshots is collected.
This script is designed to be a comprehensive keylogger that not only captures keystrokes but also records system information, clipboard content, audio, and screenshots. It sends the captured data via email, encrypts the files, and cleans up the files to avoid detection. This type of script can be used for malicious purposes, so it should be used responsibly and with permission.
